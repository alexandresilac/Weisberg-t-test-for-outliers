Demonstrating the consistency of small data sets: Application of the Weisberg t-test for outliers.16. 36-42+58. 

Determining whether a data point is an "outlier" - a result that doesn't fit, that is too high or too low, 
that is extreme or discordant - is difficult when using small data sets (such as the data from three, four, 
or five conformance runs). The authors show that the Weisberg t-test is a powerful tool for detecting deviations 
in small data sets.
