# Determining whether a data point is an "outlier" - a result that doesn't fit, that is too high or too low, 
# that is extreme or discordant - is difficult when using small data sets (such as the data from three, four, 
# or five conformance runs). The authors show that the Weisberg t-test is a powerful tool for detecting deviations 
# in small data sets.

The Weisberg outlier test is recommended for use with small sample groups, at least 5 samples and at most 15, however the code works up to 20.
To use the code, simply enter the data in the "data" field, as commented in the code.

The test confidence is, by default, 0.05 (95%). The code also offers 0.1 (90%) and 0.01 (99%). 
To make the change, simply go to the line "tcrit <- critical_T_values$X0.05[nrow(data)-4]" and change it to the chosen value.

The process can be iterative if doubts about suspected outliers persist.
To do this, simply perform the first iteration, identify the existence of outliers. Go to the data line, remove the outlier, and compile the data again, thus confirming or not the existence of more outliers.
